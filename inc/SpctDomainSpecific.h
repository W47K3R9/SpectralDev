/**
 * @section this header contains:
 * 1. Definition of constants regarding the maximum processing capability of the plugins in terms of samples.
 * These are not explicitely checked, but have been tested in the SpctDomainSpecificTest.h file, just to be sure to
 * avoid misbehaviours.
 *
 * 2. Implementation of several compile- or runtime checks if the specified limits are respected and if a number is
 * actually a power of two.
 *
 * 3. Implementation of structs to provide a conveniant domain specific way to declare variables that are guaranteed
 * to be in the valid constraints. The format is loosely related to the way the STL defines it's type infos.
 * e.g. the value of a bounded power of two (BoundedPowTwo) is accessed either directly with BoundedPowTwo::value
 * or with the "_v" suffix BoundedPowTwo_v
 *
 * @note
 * The sampling rate of a project can change at runtime. It's not recommended though to use an arbitrary large amount of
 * samples (processing power is not infinite!). For now, the maximum is set to about 341 ms at 48 kHz. That could change
 * in the future but for now it's a good starting point.
 * Furthermore, a sufficient amount of samples is needed for an accurate transformation.
 * Frequency resolution = sampling freq (fs) / number of samples (n)
 * 16 samples leads to a miserable 3 kHz resolution with 48 kHz fs but let's see how it sounds, maybe this leeds to
 * interesting experimental results.
 *
 * Concept summary:
 * - FloatingPt
 * - UnsignedL64
 * - UnsignedGE16

 * - is_bounded_degree

 *
 * Struct summary:
 * - BoundedPowTwo (value access with BoundedPowTwo_v)
 * - BoundedDegTwo (value access with BoundedDegTwo_v)
 *
 * Type aliases:
 * - IndexValueArr: array of index value pairs
